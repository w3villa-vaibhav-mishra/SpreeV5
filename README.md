# Spree Starter

This is a starter kit for [Spree Commerce](https://spreecommerce.org) - the [open-source eCommerce platform](https://spreecommerce.org) for [Rails](https://spreecommerce.org/category/ruby-on-rails/). 

It is a great starting point for any Rails developer to quickly build an eCommerce application.

This starter uses:

* **[Spree Commerce 5](https://spreecommerce.org/announcing-spree-5-the-biggest-open-source-release-ever/)**, the biggest release ever, which includes Admin Dashboard, API and Storefront - everything you need to start developing your new eCommerce application/store/marketeplace
* Stripe for payment processing, thanks to the official [Spree Stripe gem](https://github.com/spree/spree_stripe)
* [Devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) for authentication
* [Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq) for background jobs
* PostgreSQL as a database
* Redis for caching

You don't need to install additional tools or libraries to start developing with Spree Starter. Everything is already set up for you.
